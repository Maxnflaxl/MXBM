# GPU Performance

The permanent record of MXBM's GPU solver optimization: what we tried, what it
measured, and why. Every number here was produced by a committed benchmark or test
in this repository — nothing is estimated or extrapolated unless explicitly labelled.

**Target:** lolMiner does **~53 sol/s** on an RTX 4070 Ti SUPER at **stock clocks, no
special configuration** (user-measured). BeamHash III yields ~1.9 solutions per solve,
so 53 sol/s ÷ 1.9 ≈ **28 solve/s ≈ 36 ms/solve**. That is the bar.

**Reference hardware** for every measurement below: RTX 4070 Ti SUPER (Ada, sm_89,
66 CUs, 16 GB, 48 KB LDS/workgroup, ~510 GB/s achievable copy bandwidth).

**How to reproduce:** `./build/bench_rounds 20` reports the median over 20 full solves
plus a correctness gate; multiply by 1.9 for sol/s. `MXBM_NO_ROWBUCKET=1` forces the
fallback sort path.

## Progress log

Times are median ms per solve (`bench_rounds`), lower is better. "Worked" and
"Didn't work" link to the sections explaining each result.

The first row is the **real-world** starting point: the miner's own reported speed when
the GPU solver found its first share. Later rows are `bench_rounds` pipeline medians,
the controlled measurement used to make optimization decisions. Early on these disagreed
sharply — the pipeline benched at 245 ms (≈ 7.9 sol/s equivalent) while the miner
actually delivered ~1.8 sol/s, i.e. most of a solve was spent *outside* the measured
pipeline. That overhead converged (103 ms end-to-end against a 102.7 ms bench) and has
since re-opened as the pipeline got faster — see the note under the table.

Started at **1.8 sol/s** when the solver first worked → **12.6× faster**.
**Target: 53 sol/s** (lolMiner, stock) — remaining gap **~2.3×**.

VRAM for a full search fell with it: **8.36 → 6.95 GiB** (268 → 222 B/element), because
re-derivable records replaced stored work state and retired the widest bucket stride.

*The bench and the end-to-end solve have drifted apart again (83.2 vs 90 ms). That ~7 ms
sits outside the measured pipeline and is now 8 % of a solve — see
[open leads](#current-focus-and-open-leads).*

*Solutions per second (sol/s) is the number miners and pools report. BeamHash III
yields ~1.9 solutions per solve, so sol/s ≈ 1900 / (ms per solve).*

---

## Architecture

The solver runs Wagner's algorithm for Equihash⟨150,5⟩: 2^25 seed elements, five
rounds, each finding pairs that collide on a 24-bit key and combining them. BeamHash III
adds a mandatory per-round `apply_mix` that folds the element's growing index tree into
word 0, re-deriving the collision key every round.

Two collision-finding paths exist. The **fused row-bucket path** is the default wherever
device memory allows; the **sort path** is the fallback for smaller cards.

### Fused row-bucket pipeline

*One kernel per round* does round *r*'s match **and** round *r+1*'s mix **and** round
*r+1*'s scatter. Per workgroup (one per bucket × sub-mask):

1. Coalesced-load the bucket's elements into LDS (work words + gi + lead + leaf payload).
2. Build an LDS hash table over the middle key bits via `atomic_xchg` chains.
3. For each equal-key pair: order by (lead, gi), `bh3_combine` at `Lout(r)`.
4. Materialize the child's leaf prefix, fold `apply_mix(Lmix(r+1))` to set its next key.
5. Emit the child **directly into round r+1's buckets**, keyed by that fresh key.

Fusion is the point: the coalesced-gather win is destroyed if a separate scatter pass
re-reads the elements — see [Un-fused LDS path](#un-fused-lds-path).

Path selection is by device memory (`want_rowbucket` in `src/gpu/round_pipeline.cpp`):
row-bucket needs 6.95 GiB with a 2.83 GiB largest single allocation, so smaller cards fall
back to the sort path automatically. `MXBM_ROWBUCKET=1` / `MXBM_NO_ROWBUCKET=1` override.
(The *budget* still gates on a single sort-path-sized constant, which is stricter than
this — see [open leads](#current-focus-and-open-leads).)

### Round schedule

| Round | Lmix | Lout | padNum | Significant work words | Leaf payload carried |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 448 | 424 | 1 | 7 | 1 → 2 raw leaves |
| 2 | 424 | 400 | 2 | 7 | 2 → 4 raw leaves |
| 3 | 400 | 376 | 4 | 6 | 4 raw → 1 u64 `leftContrib` |
| 4 | 376 | 288 | 6 | 5 | `leftContrib` → none |
| 5 | 288 | 24 | 9 | 1 | none (terminal) |

### Stored record per round

Rounds 1–3 do not store work state at all: their elements are re-derivable from seed
indices, and those indices are also exactly the leaves the round needs, so the compact
record *replaces* the payload rather than adding to it (see
[the re-derivation chain](#the-re-derivation-chain)).

| Read by | Record | u64 | Bytes | Contents |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Round 1 | seed | 1 | 8 | `key \| index << 32` |
| Round 2 | pair | 2 | 16 | `key \| i0<<24`, `i1 \| gi<<25` |
| Round 3 | quad | 3 | 24 | `key \| i0<<24`, `i1 \| i2<<25`, `i3 \| gi<<25` |
| Round 4 | packed | 8 | 64 | 6 work words, meta, `leftContrib` |
| Round 5 | packed | 6 | 48 | 5 work words, meta |

Seed indices are 25-bit (2^25 seeds) and `gi` is 26-bit, so the pair and quad records
pack exactly with bits to spare.

## What worked

### Sort-based collision finder
Replaced the atomic-bucket scatter + all-pairs match with a stable radix sort of
(key, index) pairs and a coalesced run-scan emit. Also fused the sort-pair emission into
the mix, deleting a whole strided pass over the work array. 245 → 225 ms across P1–P4.

### Tiled radix sort
CUB-style 4-bit × 6-pass sort with per-thread private histograms and an in-place
cross-thread prefix; 8 items/thread measured optimal (16 overflows 48 KB LDS).
Sort cost per round 18 → 9.5 ms.

### Fixed-width compaction
`bh3_combine` shifts out the 24 matched bits and masks to `Lout` each round, so the
significant work words shrink on the schedule **[7, 7, 6, 5, 1]**. Storing only those
words is bit-exact (upper words are provably zero). The win requires **compile-time**
widths — see [runtime loop bounds](#runtime-loop-bounds). Measured 224.4 → 214.5 ms on
the sort path, and the same schedule was later applied to the row-bucket path.

### Fused row-bucket pipeline
The single largest win: **215 → 148 ms (−31 %)**. Built in three measured steps.

**STEP A — bucket layout.** Carrying the leaf prefix *inside* the bucket element makes
the leaf read coalesced instead of scattered, at the cost of a wider emit. Measured per
level: read win +41.2 ms, write penalty −24.1 ms → **net +17.1 ms for "fat" buckets**.
Level 5 was the exception (−1.2 ms), which later became [L5-thin](#l5-thin-emit).

**STEP B — the kernel.** `round_fused_lds`, validated byte-exact against the CPU oracle
(`ref::cpu_round`) for every leaf width, and drop-free at 2^24 scale.

**STEP C — the pipeline.** Entry kernel (seed+mix+scatter into round-1 buckets), four
fused rounds ping-ponging bucket sets, and a terminal round-5 kernel that detects
all-zero survivors. Back-refs keep the same consolidated row layout, so `recover` was
unchanged.

*Note on launch geometry:* the kernel is one **workgroup** per (bucket, sub-mask), so it
must be launched as `run1d(groups * WG, WG)` — launching `groups` work-items silently
finds 0.4 % of collisions.

### L5-thin emit
Round 4 was the most expensive round because it emitted round-5 children carrying a full
9-leaf payload. Round 5 is terminal — it never mixes, and `recover` walks back-refs — so
those leaves are dead weight. The kernel now decouples *build* from *store*: it builds
`max(padNum_next, sOut)` leaves for the child's own mix but stores only `sOut`.
Round 4: 37.2 → 29.3 ms; pipeline 151.9 → 139.1 ms.

### Per-round compaction on the row-bucket path
The `[7,7,6,5,1]` schedule applied to the fused kernel as compile-time width variants
(r3 = 7→6, r4 = 6→5), with round 5 reading at stride 5. Round 4: 29.3 → 26.8 ms;
survivor scan 6.1 → 4.6 ms.

### Async de-bubble
`run1d` blocks on `clFinish` after every kernel. In production (non-verbose) the
row-bucket pipeline now enqueues the whole chain asynchronously on the in-order queue and
drains once at the survivor readback. Only ~2 ms: the pipeline is genuinely GPU-bound, so
those waits were mostly waiting on real work.

### Compact leftContrib
Round 4's mix needs `padNum(5) = 9` leaves: **all 8** of the left parent's, but only the
right parent's **first** — which is already carried as `lead`. `apply_mix` decomposes
exactly:

```
mix = rotl24( workPart + indexPart ),   indexPart additive over leaves
```

because index bits sit at positions ≥ `Lmix` while the element's own bits sit below it
(`Lmix(r) = Lout(r-1)`) — disjoint, and `rotl` distributes over a disjoint OR. So a
round-4 element carries **one u64** instead of 8 raw leaves:

```
leftContrib = rotl40( apply_mix(0, itsOwn8Leaves, 8, 288) )        // round 3 emits this
key         = rotl24( rotl40( apply_mix(child, [0×8, rightLead], 9, 288) ) + leftContrib )
```

Both sides use the pinned `bh3_apply_mix`, so no rotation constants are duplicated. Round
3's emit drops 88 → 64 B/child and round 4's stage read by the same; the leaf buffer
shrinks 9 → 4 uints/slot (~1.1 GB). **131.1 → 124.8 ms.** The algebra is pinned by
`test_contrib_identity` (200 000 random trials) so a regression fails loudly.

### Packed element record
Elements were stored across **four parallel arrays** (work, gi, lead, leaves) indexed by
the same random slot. Global memory is serviced in **32 B sectors**, so a 4 B `gi` and a
4 B `lead` each burned a whole sector — roughly **5 sectors of traffic for a 72 B child**,
on both the scattered emit and the staging read. An isolated probe writing the same 72 B
three ways measured the cost directly:

| Layout | ms | useful GB/s |
|---|---|---|
| 4 split arrays | 21.78 | 111 |
| 1 packed record | **18.20** | **133** |
| packed, padded to 96 B (3 aligned sectors) | 18.25 | 132 |

Padding to sector alignment buys nothing beyond contiguity, so the record wastes no
bytes. The element is now one contiguous block:

```
[work: inwords u64][meta: (gi << 32) | lead][leaf payload: two u32 per u64]
```

Strides are per-round runtime arguments while every **loop bound stays compile-time**, so
the word loops still fully unroll. Bucket capacity was retuned to `mean + mean/4 + 256`
to keep the widest packed array under the 3.9 GB single-allocation limit — still ~17σ of
headroom against a distribution whose max sits near mean + 4.5σ, and drop counters gate
every run. **124.8 → 115.7 ms**, every round faster, and ~4 GB less memory.

### Seed re-derivation
Round-1 elements are **seeds**: each is fully determined by its 25-bit index via
7 × `siphash24` + `apply_mix`. We were storing the resulting 72 B record and reading it
straight back. GPUs are compute-rich and memory-poor, and the isolated measurement is
lopsided:

| | ms |
|---|---|
| Recompute only (7 × siphash24 + apply_mix) | 2.47 |
| Entry storing 8 B `(index, key)` | 2.50 |
| Entry storing the 72 B packed record | 18.16 |

Recompute costs **14 %** of what storing the record costs. The round-1 bucket record is
now a bare 8 B `(index << 32) | key`, and a fused variant (`LMODE_SEED`) re-derives the
56 B work state while staging into LDS. The key is still stored so the sub-mask scan
stays cheap; only the ~1/8 of a bucket each pass owns is expanded, so every element is
derived exactly once across the 8 passes.

**114.8 → 102.7 ms.** The entry pass drops 19.2 → 2.7 ms, and round 1 pays +3.6 ms of
recompute for a 15.7 ms saving.

This is the first confirmation of the compute-for-memory trade that BeamHash III's 3 GB
design target implies (see [HW_REQUIREMENTS.md](HW_REQUIREMENTS.md)): the solver is
bandwidth-bound, so paying arithmetic to avoid moving bytes wins.

### The non-divergent expand

The single most useful structural finding so far, and the key that unlocked
[the re-derivation chain](#the-re-derivation-chain).

The fused kernel stages a bucket in a **sub-mask filtered** loop:

```c
for (uint p = lId; p < cnt; p += LDS_WG) {      // cnt ~ 2048, 8 iterations
    uint key = ...;
    if ((key & (submaskCount - 1u)) != mask) continue;   // ~7/8 of lanes leave
    uint pos = atomic_inc(&gcount);
    /* ...work here runs at ~4 of 32 lanes per warp... */
}
```

With `submaskBits = 3` only ~1/8 of lanes survive the filter, so **anything expensive
placed there executes at ~4/32 lane utilisation**. Immediately afterwards the kernel runs
a second loop over the ~256 staged elements — `for (pos = lId; pos < total; pos += 256)` —
which is a single iteration with **every lane active**.

Moving the seed derivation from the first loop to the second is therefore free of any
structural cost: same seeds, same LDS, no extra barrier (the index was already parked in
`lgi`), 8× the SIMD utilisation.

**Round 1: 26.4 → 18.5 ms; pipeline 103.6 → 95.3 ms.** Round 1 became the *fastest* round,
which is what it should always have been — its input record is 8 B against every other
round's 64–72 B.

This also explains, retrospectively, why
[the first round-2 attempt](#round-2-re-derivation-first-attempt) failed so badly: it was
never an arithmetic problem, only a placement one.

### The re-derivation chain

With the divergence removed, "store indices, rebuild the element" extends up the pipeline.
Each round's element is a combine of two of the previous round's, so an element at round
*r* is determined by 2^(r-1) seed indices — **and those indices are exactly the leaves that
round already has to carry**. The compact record therefore replaces the leaf payload and
the work words together, rather than adding to them:

| | Record | Emit (round *r*−1) | Stage read (round *r*) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 2 | 16 B pair (2 indices) | 72 → 16 B | 72 → 16 B |
| Round 3 | 24 B quad (4 indices) | 80 → 24 B | 80 → 24 B |

The rebuild cost was measured **in situ** before either was implemented, using a probe
that re-derives the element and overwrites the staged work state *while still reading the
old record* — so the delta is the recompute alone, and it self-verifies against the
goldens. Round 2's rebuild measured **+0.4 ms**, against **+23.5 ms** for the identical
arithmetic in the divergent slot.

> A probe like this must be **liveness-checked**. A golden pass alone proves nothing: if
> the compiler had eliminated the recompute, `lwork` would simply retain the correct
> loaded value and the goldens would pass anyway. Writing garbage through the probe and
> confirming the goldens *break* is what establishes the measurement is real. (A first
> attempt at this control — perturbing `Lout` 424 → 425 — was a no-op, because
> `bh3_combine` already leaves bit 424 zero.)

Measured results:

| | Round *r*−1 emit | Round *r* stage+rebuild | Pipeline |
|---|---|---|---|
| Round 2 pair record | 18.2 → 12.1 ms | 24.2 → 21.3 ms | 95.3 → 86.8 ms |
| Round 3 quad record | 21.3 → 15.0 ms | 24.2 → 26.5 ms | 86.8 → 83.2 ms |

**The chain stops at round 3.** Round 2's 14 siphashes/element hid almost entirely inside
the kernel's existing memory stalls (+0.4 ms); round 3's 28 exceeded what is hideable and
cost ~9 ms of exposed compute, more than the traffic it removed locally — round 3 is only
net-positive because of what it saves on *round 2's emit*. Round 4 would need 56
siphashes for a 64 → 32 B record: twice the compute for half the saving, on the wrong side
of a boundary round 3 already crosses. It was not implemented. See
[the compute-hiding budget](#established-limits).

As a side effect the widest bucket stride (10 u64) retired, so both ping-pong buffers
shrank 20 % and a full search now fits in **6.95 GiB** (222 B/element), down from 8.36 GiB.
[HW_REQUIREMENTS.md](HW_REQUIREMENTS.md) had predicted exactly this — it listed
"index-only storage with re-derivation" as a route to the 3 GB target and argued memory
efficiency and throughput were probably the same problem. Both moved together.

---

## What didn't work

Each of these was measured and reverted. They are recorded so they are not retried.

### SoA word planes
One buffer per element word, skipping zero planes. Measured **only 1 % better** than
fixed-width AoS (14.22 vs 14.42 ms) — not worth a full-pipeline rewrite. An AoS element
write touches ~1 cache line; the same element in SoA fans across W buffers.

### Runtime loop bounds
The first compaction attempt used runtime-variable word-loop bounds (`w < inW`). This
defeats compiler unrolling and cost **+24 to +27 ms**. Compile-time widths are mandatory
everywhere in the hot path; this failure mode recurred twice.

### Un-fused LDS path
Bucket-scatter as a *separate* pass, then an LDS collide pass: **244 ms, slower than the
215 ms sort path**. The separate fat scatter consumes exactly the coalesced-gather win it
enables. This is why the row-bucket rewrite had to fuse.

### Stride-1 lead array
Publishing leaf 0 into a dedicated dense array so the pair-ordering read would be
sequential. Goldens stayed correct but match **regressed 158.9 → 176.3 ms**. Leaf 0 is
cache-adjacent to the leaf-prefix data the same kernel already reads, so splitting it out
added a second memory stream. The lead read and prefix build are cache-coupled; neither
can be peeled off alone.

### Occupancy tuning
The fused kernel uses ~41 KB of the 48 KB LDS → exactly **1 workgroup/SM (~17 %
occupancy)**. Two attempts to buy occupancy both lost:
- Halving the group cap and adding a sub-mask bit (LDS 41 → 22 KB, 2 wg/SM): **slower**,
  because a finer sub-mask re-scans each bucket 16× instead of 8×.
- De-fusing to free the 12 KB leaf array only reaches 29 KB — still >24 KB, so still
  1 wg/SM — while re-introducing the +17 ms scattered leaf gather.

Decisively: [decoupled scatter](#decoupled-scatter) proved occupancy is irrelevant to the
dominant cost anyway.

### Dense key array
A dense per-slot key array so the sub-mask scan reads 4 B coalesced instead of striding
into the 56 B work records. **Slower (133 → 146 ms)**: the redundant strided key scan is
already L2-served and was never DRAM-bound, so the extra array was pure added traffic.

### Decoupled scatter
Hypothesis: the emit is slow because the fused kernel's low occupancy can't hide its
latency, so a standalone high-occupancy scatter kernel would be faster. **Refuted.**
`test_scatter_occupancy` runs the identical scatter at three LDS footprints:

| LDS/workgroup | ms | GB/s |
|---|---|---|
| tiny (max occupancy) | 14.44 | 260 |
| 24 KB (~2 wg/SM) | 14.21 | 265 |
| 40 KB (fused-kernel occupancy) | 14.21 | 264 |

Identical (lo/hi = 0.98×). The scatter is **random-access-bound, not latency-bound**, at
~51 % of the 510 GB/s coalesced peak. Bucket count is equally irrelevant: 264 GB/s at
1024 buckets vs 260 GB/s at 16384 (256 buckets is *slower*, 221 GB/s, from counter
contention).

### Global gi atomic
Suspected the per-child `atomic_inc` on a single global counter was serializing the emit.
Stubbed it out: **no speedup** — NVIDIA's atomic aggregation already handles it. The
per-bucket counters were tested too (`scatter_noatomic`): removing them made the scatter
**slower** (235 vs 260 GB/s), because `atomic_inc` hands out sequential in-bucket slots,
which is *better* locality than a computed slot.

### Shared-memory magazine
Staging children in LDS per destination bucket and flushing coalesced. Infeasible at our
fan-out: a workgroup produces ~256 children spread over 16384 buckets, so magazines hold
~1 element and never fill. Confirmed by the literature (local-reorder needs ≤256 bins) and
by Wilke Trei's own FishHashMiner, which contains no magazine.

### SoA LDS staging
The LDS staging array used AoS indexing `lwork[pos*7 + w]` — a stride of 7 ulongs = 14
uints, and `gcd(14, 32 banks) = 2`, so every access was nominally a 2-way bank conflict.
Switching to plane-major SoA (`lwork[w*CAP + pos]`) measured **125.7–125.9 vs 124.8 ms —
reproducibly ~1 ms slower**. The dominant LDS accesses are in the collision-walk, where
`leftPos`/`rightPos` come from hash-chain traversal and are scattered under either
layout; only the staging loop has consecutive indices, and it is the minority of
accesses. (Note this is LDS layout only — the *global* packing win above is a separate,
real effect.)

### Round-2 re-derivation (first attempt)

> **Superseded — this was diagnosed and is now shipping.** The conclusion below ("round 2
> is past the threshold") was **wrong about the cause**. The arithmetic was never the
> problem; its *placement* was. Re-measured in the
> [non-divergent expand](#the-non-divergent-expand), the same recompute costs **+0.4 ms

The natural extension of [seed re-derivation](#seed-re-derivation): a round-2 element is
one combine away from two seeds, so it could be stored as a 16 B
`(leftIdx, rightIdx, key, gi)` record instead of the 72 B packed one — and its two leaves
*are* those indices. Isolated, the arithmetic looked clearly profitable:

| | ms |
|---|---|
| Re-derive a round-2 element (2 seeds + 2 mixes + combine + mix) | 5.27 |
| Traffic it removes (emit 72→16 B, plus round 2's stage read) | ~11.4 |

**Implemented and reverted: round 2 went 23.2 → 46.7 ms** (total 107 → 131). The
re-derivation cost **4.5× its standalone measurement** once inside the fused kernel.
Aliasing the combine output to cut 7 registers changed nothing (48.3 ms), so register
count alone is not the explanation; the staging loop's sub-mask filter leaves only ~1/8
of a warp's lanes active during the recompute, and at round 2's working-set size that
divergence plus the added occupancy pressure swamps the traffic saved.

**The lesson that survives:** a standalone measurement of recomputation cost is not
transferable into the fused kernel — measure **in situ**. The lesson that did *not*
survive is the threshold claim; "in situ" turned out to mean *in the right loop*, and
"measured in situ" is not the same as "measured in the best available placement".

### Deferring the stage read
[The non-divergent expand](#the-non-divergent-expand) won by moving compute out of the
sub-mask-filtered loop, so the obvious next step was to move the **64–72 B record load**
out too — park the slot index, read the record in the all-lanes loop. **Slower** (r2
24.3 → 26.2, r3 24.5 → 25.9, r4 25.1 → 27.5 ms).

The loads were never the problem. The staging loop runs **8 iterations**, so its loads
already overlap across iterations; the all-lanes loop runs **one**, so deferring collapses
that memory-level parallelism and adds an LDS round-trip on top. Divergence costs
*compute*, not *bandwidth* — the two halves of the staging loop want opposite treatment,
and that is why only the recompute moved.

### Register cap tuning
Round 3's rebuild costs ~9 ms of exposed compute where round 2's cost 0.4 ms — superlinear
enough to suspect the compiler was spilling, since it budgets registers for an occupancy
this LDS-bound kernel (1 workgroup/SM) can never reach. Swept
`-cl-nv-maxrregcount` over {96, 128, 168, 200}:

| Cap | r1 | r2 | r3 | r4 | Σ |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| default | 12.1 | 15.1 | 26.5 | 25.6 | 79.3 |
| 128 | 12.2 | 17.1 | 26.1 | 24.1 | 79.5 |
| 168 | 13.2 | 17.1 | 25.2 | 24.1 | 79.6 |

A wash — r3/r4 gain what r2 loses. **Spilling is not the explanation**; the rebuild is
genuinely more arithmetic than the kernel's memory stalls can hide. Retained as the
`MXBM_CL_OPTS` diagnostic knob, defaulting to empty.

### Two-level bucketing
The last structural idea: partition coarsely (256 bins, long runs, coalesced flush) then
refine. Settled by measuring the **coalescing benefit curve** directly (`scatter_runs`)
— run length is the only thing any reorder scheme changes:

| Emit width | Real (random dest) | Perfect (R=32) | Max reorder gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| 56 B (r1/r2) | 260 GB/s | 497 GB/s | 1.91× |
| 48 B (r3) | 260 GB/s | 547 GB/s | 2.10× |
| 40 B (r4) | 261 GB/s | 578 GB/s | 2.22× |

Our emit is **write-only** — children are produced in registers, there is no source read
to amortize — so two-level costs 1 write + 1 read + 1 write against today's single write:

```
break even needs   1/260 > 1/BW_A + 2/BW_B
at the card's peak  3/578 = 0.00519  ≫  1/260 = 0.00385
```

Two-level would need coalesced bandwidth **> 780 GB/s**, above the card's 510 GB/s peak.
**Impossible on this hardware**, at every width — including the late-round "thinner
element" hybrid, which clears a naive 2× bar but still fails this one.

### General compact mix-state
The `leftContrib` decomposition ([above](#compact-leftcontrib)) raises the question of
carrying mix state instead of leaves everywhere. It does not generalize: `Lmix` changes
every round, so a contribution precomputed at one round's base is useless at the next, and
computing any round's contribution requires the raw leaves anyway. Serving all future
rounds would cost more than the leaves it replaces. Round 4 is the sole exception because
it needs *all* of one parent's leaves and only *one* of the other's.

## Established limits

Measured properties of the problem on this hardware. These bound what any further
optimization can achieve.

1. **The element cannot shrink below `[7,7,6,5,1]`.** That schedule is BeamHash III's
   information floor, confirmed independently by Wilke Trei's own `beamhashverify`
   reference. The compact 16 B element in the official `BeamMW/cuda-miner` belongs to
   **BeamHash I** (2018, pre-Fork2: shift-out-key running XOR, no per-round `apply_mix`),
   and does not transfer.
2. **`apply_mix` is genuinely per-round**, folding padNum ∈ {1,2,4,6,9} index-tree entries
   into word 0. It rewrites only word 0; words 1–6 pass through read-only.
3. **A key-random fat scatter runs at ~260 GB/s (51 % of peak)** and is invariant to
   occupancy, bucket count, and atomics. It is random-access-bound.
4. **Coalescing cannot be bought back** — maximum 1.91–2.22×, against a 3× traffic cost
   for any two-pass scheme.
5. **Divergence is only paid by compute.** Work placed in the sub-mask-filtered staging
   loop runs at ~4/32 lanes; the same work in the following all-lanes loop runs at 32/32.
   For *arithmetic* this is worth up to ~58× (round 2's rebuild: 23.5 → 0.4 ms). For
   *loads* the ordering reverses — the staging loop's 8 iterations overlap their loads,
   the all-lanes loop's single iteration cannot
   ([measured](#deferring-the-stage-read)).
6. **The compute-hiding budget is finite, and round 3 is where it runs out.** The fused
   kernel stalls on memory, and arithmetic issued into those stalls is free until it
   exceeds them. Round 2's rebuild (14 siphashes/element) cost +0.4 ms — essentially all
   hidden. Round 3's (28) cost ~9 ms — essentially all exposed. This is not register
   spilling ([register cap](#register-cap-tuning) is a wash); it is the stall budget
   being used up. Any future compute-for-memory trade should be sized against this
   boundary, not assumed to scale.

Consequence: element size, coalescing, occupancy and atomics are all settled — but the
gap is no longer as unexplained as it looked. Two of the four rounds now store no work
state at all, and both memory and time fell together, which is what
[HW_REQUIREMENTS.md](HW_REQUIREMENTS.md) predicted would happen if the two were the same
problem. lolMiner's remaining ~2.3× may be more of the same rather than an unknown
technique — but rounds 4 and 5, which still store full work state, are past the
compute-hiding boundary, so it cannot be more of *literally* the same.

## Current focus and open leads

**Where the time goes** (83.2 ms): r1 12.1, r2 15.1, r3 26.5, r4 25.6, plus a 2.8 ms entry
and a 4.4 ms terminal. The shape has changed — rounds 1–2 have roughly halved, and
**rounds 3–4 are now 63 % of the solve**.

**The governing constraint.** Every win so far came from *moving fewer bytes*, and the
[established limits](#established-limits) show the scattered emit is already at the
hardware's random-access ceiling (~260 GB/s, ~51 % of peak) and cannot be coalesced.
Reducing *what* is stored is therefore the only lever with real headroom — which is also
what the algorithm's 3 GB design target implies
(see [HW_REQUIREMENTS.md](HW_REQUIREMENTS.md)). What is new is that this lever is now
bounded on the other side too, by the
[compute-hiding budget](#established-limits): rounds 4–5 cannot pay for their storage in
arithmetic the way rounds 1–3 did.

**Leads, most promising first:**

1. **Attack rounds 3–4 as the new majority.** They are 52 of 83 ms. Round 4 still stores
   full work state (64 B in, 48 B out) and full re-derivation is ruled out, so the
   question is whether anything *cheaper than a full rebuild* shrinks its record — a
   partial rebuild, or storing an intermediate that costs fewer than 56 siphashes to
   expand. Unexplored, and the only lead sized to the remaining gap.
2. **Eliminate the stored `gi`.** An element's identity could be its bucket slot
   (`bucket × cap + pos`) rather than a stored 4 B counter value, removing 4 B from every
   emit and every stage read. Requires back-reference rows indexed by slot (larger, but
   `fb_gi` disappears) and changes the `(lead, gi)` tie-break to `(lead, slot)` — valid,
   since ties only occur between equal-lead pairs, which the CPU gate rejects anyway.
   Now worth more at rounds 4–5 than at 1–3, where the record is already tiny.
3. **The ~7 ms outside the pipeline.** `bench_rounds` medians 83.2 ms while
   `GpuSolver::solve()` measures 90 ms. That gap was ~0 at 102.7 ms and is now 8 % of a
   solve; it is pure overhead (setup, readback, recovery, verification) and has never been
   profiled because it never mattered.
4. **Per-path VRAM budget.** `kBytesPerElement = 304` is sized for the *sort* path; the
   row-bucket path now needs 222. A single constant covers both, so row-bucket cards are
   still assessed against the sort path's appetite — which is what forces the ≥ 14.6 GiB
   threshold documented in [HW_REQUIREMENTS.md](HW_REQUIREMENTS.md). Splitting it is the
   remaining work to make 12 GB cards viable.
5. **Tighter bucket capacity.** `mean + mean/4 + 256` is ~17σ of headroom against a
   distribution whose max sits near mean + 4.5σ. Cutting it shrinks every bucket array
   proportionally, but must stay drop-free across nonces, so it needs a measured
   occupancy distribution rather than a guess.

**Done since this list was last written:** re-derivation in a non-divergent context (lead
1, −20.4 ms across rounds 1–3) and per-set stride sizing (old lead 3, folded into the
quad-record change — the 10 u64 stride retired entirely).

**Ruled out — do not revisit** (all measured, see [What didn't work](#what-didnt-work)):
two-level bucketing, shared-memory magazines, warp-aggregated atomics, decoupling the
scatter for occupancy, SoA layouts in either global or local memory, and shrinking the
element below the `[7,7,6,5,1]` schedule.

Correctness gates that must stay green for any performance change:
`bucketDrops == 0`, `pairDrops == 0`, all three KAT goldens byte-identical, and the full
suite. The goldens are checked through every collision path
(`gpu_*_rowbucket`, `gpu_*_lds`, `gpu_*_legacy`) so a path-specific regression is caught.

Diagnostic environment variables: `MXBM_ROWBUCKET` / `MXBM_NO_ROWBUCKET`,
`MXBM_LEGACY_MATCH`, `MXBM_LDS_MATCH`, `MXBM_NO_COMPACT`, `MXBM_SORT_PROFILE`,
`MXBM_ABLATE` (bit 0 skips `apply_mix`, bit 1 skips the fat emit — for phase attribution),
`MXBM_CL_OPTS` (extra OpenCL build options for the fused program, e.g.
`-cl-nv-maxrregcount=128`; see [register cap](#register-cap-tuning)).
